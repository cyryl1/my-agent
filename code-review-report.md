# Code Review Summary

## Overall Summary

The provided changes to `index.ts` primarily focus on integrating a new `reviewFormatterTool` into the existing `codeReviewAgent`. This involves importing the new tool and registering it within the agent's tool set. Additionally, two unused imports (`path` and `fs/promises`) have been removed, which is a good practice for maintaining a clean codebase.

## Detailed Suggestions

1. ### 1. Clarity and Purpose of `reviewFormatterTool`
2. - **Suggestion:** While the integration is clear, it would be beneficial to add a small comment or update the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (if applicable and visible in these changes) to explain *how* and *when* the `reviewFormatterTool` is intended to be used by the agent. This clarifies its role in the overall code review process.
3. - **Reasoning:** Understanding the tool's intended application helps with future maintenance and debugging.
4. ### 2. Tool Naming Consistency (Minor)
5. - **Suggestion:** The other tools like `getFileChangesInDirectoryTool`, `generateMarkdownFileTool`, `generateCommitMessageTool` are quite descriptive in their names, matching the file name. `reviewFormatterTool` is consistent, but it's worth a quick thought if `formatCodeReviewTool` or `writeCodeReviewTool` might be even more explicit if its primary function is to *write* the formatted review to a file, as suggested by `reviewFormatterTool`'s definition. However, `reviewFormatterTool` is perfectly acceptable if its scope is purely formatting.
6. - **Reasoning:** Consistent and explicit naming conventions enhance readability and maintainability across the codebase.
7. ### 3. Removed Imports
8. - **Acknowledgement:** Good job on removing the unused `path` and `fs/promises` imports. This keeps the module dependencies clean and reduces potential confusion.
